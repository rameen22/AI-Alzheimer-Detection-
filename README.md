Alzheimer's Disease Classification from MRI Images:

This project focuses on building a powerful neural network model to accurately classify Alzheimer's disease stages using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. Alzheimer's disease exhibits identifiable stages that can be discerned through medical imaging, and this project aims to leverage deep learning to enhance classification accuracy.

Objective
The primary objective is to develop and deploy a deep learning model capable of precisely predicting Alzheimer's disease stages by analyzing MRI scans. The model categorizes scans into stages such as NonDemented, Very Mild Demented, Mild Demented, and Moderate Demented.

Key Features:

Data Preparation
Utilize MRI images to construct a comprehensive dataset for effective model training and validation.

Neural Network Model
Implemented a deep learning architecture, such as CNN, to achieve robust image classification.

Model Training
Trained the neural network using labeled MRI images to predict different disease progression stages and saved it to use in website.

Web Interface
Develop a user-friendly web application enabling users to interact with the trained model. Users can upload MRI images for disease classification, and the web interface encompasses features like patient record management, MRI upload, report generation, and more.

Project Structure
Data Collection:

Gather MRI scans with corresponding stage labels (from Kaggle or other reliable sources).

Data Processing:
Preprocess the images, convert them to an appropriate format, and split them into training and test sets.

Model Development:
Create and train a neural network model on the prepared dataset.

Model Deployment:

Save the trained model for potential deployment or future use.

Web Interface Development:

Design and develop a user-friendly web interface allowing users to upload MRI images, obtain disease classification results, and generate reports.
Technologies Used
Python
Keras with TensorFlow backend
OpenCV for image processing
CNN for the base model architecture
HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Bootstrap for web interface development
Web Interface Details
The project includes a well-crafted web interface that facilitates user interaction with the trained model. Users can seamlessly upload MRI images, and the model provides predictions on Alzheimer's disease stages. Additionally, the web interface incorporates features for patient record management, MRI uploading, report generation, and more.
